BHGC Website
============

This repository contains the framework for building the (future) [BHGC website](http://bhgc.org/alpha/).  This new website is mobile friendly.


### Build site on the fly

```s
source('http://bhgc.org/alpha/build#BHGC')
```
This will build a local copy of the site in local directory html/.
