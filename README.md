BHGC Website
============

This repository contains the framework for building the (future) [BHGC website](http://bhgc.org/).

To build the site, you need to run [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and call:

```s
source('http://bhgc.org/alpha/build#BHGC')
```

This will build a local copy of the site in local directory html/.
