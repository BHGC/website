# Student mailing list for 2014/2015

New hang gliding students are joining the club for our 2014/2015
training session.  The club uses a 'students' mailing list to reach
out to everyone part of the training, but also to anyone else in the
club who is interested in going down to Ed Levin (our training site).
Please feel free to use this least to ask questions and discuss your
training.  Messages sent to this list will also reach all of the
club's instructors.

**Task for new student**: If you're one of the lucky ones joining the
  club this year, **please enter your information below**.  

**Task for everyone else**: At this time each year we refresh the
'students' list by removing everyone.  This is done to make sure it
connects with the correct people and don't spam anyone.  If you wish
to be/remain on this mailing list, **make sure to add yourself back by
entering you information below**.
