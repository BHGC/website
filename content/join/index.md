## To the unlucky ones

We thank everyone who came to the signup meeting.
As of October 10, 2016, we have selected new students using a lottery
system. Students who were selected have already been informed.
As usual there was some turnover early on and a few people on the wait
list got in this way.  Unfortunately, no more people will be able to
join from now on.

Those who were not lucky at the lottery had the option to sign up to
be on the wait list in case any students drop out.
People on the wait list has also been informed - **check your email inbox!**
There is usually some turnover early on.  To get in from this wait
list, make sure to attend the ground school (see [front page]).
