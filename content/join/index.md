## To the unlucky ones

We thank everyone who came to the signup meeting.
As of September 17, 2025, we have selected new students using a lottery
system.
<%-- Students who were selected have already been informed.
As usual there was some turnover early on and a few people on the waitlist
got in this way.  Unfortunately, no more people will be able to
join from now on. --%>

Those who were not lucky at the lottery had the option to sign up to
be on the waitlist in case any students drop out.
People on the waitlist has also been informed.
<%--
There is usually some turnover early on.
To get in from this waitlist, make sure to attend the ground school
