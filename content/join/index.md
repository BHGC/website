## To the unlucky ones

We thank everyone who came to the signup meeting for their interest.
As of Sept 18, 2014, we have selected new 2014 students using a lottery
system. Students who were selected have already been informed/emailed.
Those who where not lucky at the lottery had the option to sign up to
be on a wait list in case any students drop.
<%--
There is usually some turnover early on. the ground school (see [Home]).
To get in from this wait list, make sure to attend the ground school
(see [Home]).
--%>
As usual there was some turnover early on and a few people on the wait
list got in this way.  Unfortunately, no more people will be able to
join from now on.

## Next chance is in September 2015

The next round of sign ups for new pilot students will be announced
on this website in Aug/Sept 2015. Signup happens once a year, typically
in early September (after the Labor Day weekend), and only in person.
As a rough guide, see previous years below. See also the [About] page.
