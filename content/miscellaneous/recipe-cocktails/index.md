## Mr. Pimm's Saturday Afternoon Affair

**Ingredients:**

* 1 oz vodka
* 0.5 oz Pimm's Cup No. 1
* 0.5 oz Cointreau
* 1 lemon
* 4 shakes Angostura Bitters
* 3 shakes Fee Brothers West Indies Orange Bitters
* Ginger Beer (Bundaberg, Reed's, or Cock & Bull)
* (optional) Tea bag (black, chai, or Bengal Spice)

(1 oz = 30 ml)

**Directions:**

1. Juice lemon into ice-filled shaker.
2. Add Cointreau, Pimm's, and vodka.
3. Add both bitters, plus tea bag (if desired).
4. Shake and strain into highball glass with 3 or 4 ice cubes.
5. Top with ginger beer.

You can adjust the strength of the drink by varying the amount of
vodka (0x - 2x works).  You can adjust sweetness by varying the ratio
of Pimm's to Cointreau, as long as the total volume of the two is 1 oz
(personally, I prefer 0.33 Cointreau and 0.66 Pimm's).  Also, be
careful about the amount of ginger beer you top with, it's easy to get
too sweet.

If you don't have bitters, you can get away with just using tea and
steeping in the shaker for an extra minute.  The Bengal Spice is
especially good in this case.  However, DO NOT try to make this drink
without either tea or bitters, it's nasty!  (Cathy calls it Mr. Pimm's
Breakup when I forget the bitters.)
