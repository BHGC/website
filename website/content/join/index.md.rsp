To the unlucky ones
-------------------

As of Sept 18, we have selected new 2013 students using a lottery
system. Students who were selected have already been informed/emailed.
Those who where not lucky at the lottery had the option to sign up to
be on a wait list in case any students drop. There is usually some
turnover early on. To get in from this wait list, make sure to attend
the ground school (see [front page](/)).

Next chance is in Sept 2014
---------------------------

When the next round of sign ups for new pilot students will be announced
on this website in Aug/Sept 2014. Signup typically happens once a year
in early September. As a rough guide, see previous years below. See also
the [About](\) page.
